## Educational Game Management

Teachers can now more easily create and manage educational games where students learn through playing the game.  This is useful for any learning subject or education level.  The multiplayer installable features of CS1 Game Engine Applications provide the perfect context for collaborative learning.  Teachers can use the CS1 Admin App to track students game stats which can be designed to correspond with specific learning achievements.  Computer science teachers are encouraged to reach out to other subject teachers to help them design and build their own custom learning games.
